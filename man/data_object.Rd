\description{
The table \emph{data_object} contains the downloaded data for each object
batch. Each line contains the search \emph{hits} for each \emph{keyword} in
an object \emph{batch_o} for a given \emph{location} and \emph{date}. The
column \emph{batch_c} indicates the control batch to which the data will be
mapped. Global data takes the value \emph{world} as location. Data is
downloaded and automatically written to the table through the function
\code{download_object}. The function \code{start_db} exports the table
\emph{data_object} as database connection \code{tbl_object} to
the package environment. Users can access the database table through
\code{dplyr::tbl}.
The sample data included in \code{data_object} was simulated based on actual
Google Trends data.

Example data for the table \emph{data_object} is available as R object
\code{example_object}.
